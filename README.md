# wizard-js-remake
Remake of my Greenfoot wizard game.
Link to the original Java version: https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/27474

The main file is index.html
Running this requires you to download the "xander-js-3" submodule. 
https://github.com/Ehren-Strifling/xander-js-3

If you do not want to download it then you can try wizard-js-web.html. It should work as long as you are online.
The game is still in the prototyping phase, there are no high scores yet nor any wizard respawning.

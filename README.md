# wizard-js-remake
Remake of my Greenfoot wizard game.
Link to the original Java version: https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/27474

The main file is index.html
Running this requires you to download the "xander-js-3" submodule. 
https://github.com/Ehren-Strifling/xander-js-3

If you do not want to download it then you can try **wizard-js-portable.html** in the portable folder. It should work as long as you are online.

The game is still in the prototyping phase, there are no high scores yet nor any wizard respawning.

## Main Controls
Use **WASD** or the **arrow keys** to move. Hold **spacebar** to cast magic.
Your character is the wizard in the center of the screen. Use the mouse to aim.

You can also pause and unpause the game by pressing the **esc** key.

### More controls
Press the **X** key to set your auto-aim target to a wizard nearby your mouse. Press **Z** to unset your target.
_If your auto aim target is defeated then you will automatically target another nearby enemy wizard._

Holding **shift** will override the auto-aim and resume aiming towards your mouse. Spells that track wizards will still prioritise your set target.
